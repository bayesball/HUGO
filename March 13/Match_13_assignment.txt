4.  Try out my Shiny app that displays a scatterplot of a particular FanGraphs pitching measure for two consecutive seasons.

For each pitching measure, find the correlation between the measure for the two seasons.

Rank the pitching measures from best (top) to worst (bottom) in measuring pitching ability.

5.  Your project will be to write a blog post that summarizes what you've learned and applies it to your situation (playing for your baseball team).  Write a brief outline on the type of things in this blog post.
