January 19 Assignment

I've added a new data file "four_pitchers.csv" in the January 19 folder on my Github site:

For your assignment, explore the pitches of your four selected pitchers.  Here are some questions to answer (write out answers to the questions in full sentences).

For each pitcher ...

1.  What types of pitches does he commonly throw?

2.  Can you describe each of these pitch types in terms of speed and break 
(horizontal and vertical)?     Base your answer on the scatterplots of the break values.

3.  Where in the zone is a particular type of pitch thrown?

4.  Which type of pitch will most likely result in a swinging strike?  

5.  Which type of pitch will most likely result in a called strike?

Basically, you are writing a paragraph scouting report for each pitcher, describing what you are learning from your work on the Statcast data.  

I'd like you to turn in your four paragraphs before our next meeting.

Here is a similar writeup based on what I discussed in our meeting.
