# November 10 Assignment

# PART I

# Work through the flights example material from Chapter 5 -
# Data Transformation from Data Science with R

# PART II

# Pitching is a data frame with 48,399 observations and 30 variables.  A row consists of stats for a specific pitcher for a given season and stint (if a player is traded midseason, he may have several stints within a single season).

# 1.  Assuming at least 100 innings pitched, who had the best season ERA in all seasons 1960 or later?

#  2.  Again assuming at least 100 innings pitched and seasons 1960 or later, who had the best season WHIP value?

#  3.  Considering all seasons 1960 or later, which pitcher had the best career WHIP measure?

#  4.  Suppose you are interested in a pitchers ratio of strikeouts to walks.  For the 2000 season, which pitcher had the best SO / BB ratio?  (Assume at least 100 innings pitched.)

# Teams is a data frame with 2985 observations and 48 variables.  A row consists of season records for a given team in a given season.

#  5.  Which team had the best win/loss percentage in a single season?

#  6.  Find the 10 teams who had the best win/loss records in a single season since 1920.  How many of these teams won the World Series?

#  7.  One can compute the expected number of wins for a team by use of the Bill James formula:

#  E = G \times \frac{R^2}{R^2 + RA^2}

# One can measure a team's success by seeing how many wins a team has above expected.

# Luck = W - E

# For all teams in seasons 1960 or later, which teams had the highest Luck values?  Which teams had the lowest Luck values?

# CAN YOU TURN IN YOUR R SCRIPT FOR YOUR WORK BY
# NEXT WEEK (November 17)?
