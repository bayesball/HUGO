# January 26 meeting

# Statcast measures launch angle (degrees) and
# exit velocity (mph) of each ball put into play

# also the location of the batted ball on the field is
# measured from which you can compute a spray angle

# explore launch angles and exit velocities

# balls hit with suitable values of LA and EV tend
# to be hits

# show figure 1

# relate to the type of batted ball (ground ball,
# line drive, fly ball, pop up)

# Statcast data has a variable estimated_ba_using_speedangle
# which estimates the probability of a hit for a
# batted ball given the LA and LS measurements

# define xH = expected hits
# define xBA = expected batting average
# define HA = hits added = H - xH

# compute for each hitter in the 2022 season
# H, xH, BA, xBA, HA
