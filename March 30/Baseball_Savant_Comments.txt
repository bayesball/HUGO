2022 Pitch Distribution
- shows frequency of use and pitch speed
- doesn't clearly show differences in frequency in use

2022 MLB Percentile Rankings
- 14 measures
- what do we learn about Nola's strengths?
- xERA / xwOBA interesting stat
- some of these measures like Barrel% are hitter stats (most variation in Barrel% is due to hitters rather than pitcher)
- 90 for Chase Rate

Trends in xwOBA over time
- what are we looking for?

Statcast Statistics
- Usefulness of Max EV
- nice to highlight unusually low or high values
- see obvious trend in average launch angle over seasons
- definition of sweet spot?

Statcast Pitch Arsenal
- shows location of each pitch
- allows for filtering to look at RH, LH, ahead in count, behind in count, etc.
- suggestion:  add some comparative graphs

Pitch % Across Seasons
- are we interested in comparison of pitch % -- if so, that would be a different graph
- pop-up menus allow one to plot other measures across season

Pitch Tracking
- gives stats for each pitch type
- usefulness of this table?  
- just counts that are hard to interpret

Batted Ball Profile
- different batted ball stats for each season
- Player and MLB rows correspond to all Nola seasons?
- does show "similar" pitchers to Nola with respect to batted balls

Pitch Movement
- different pitch movement stats by season
- different line for each pitch type

Table of vertical and horizontal movements for each pitch type for each season

Run Values by Pitch Type
- table of run values by pitch type by season

Spin Direction
- table of spin stats by pitch type by season
- hard to interpret the table values
- have to figure out the special graphic

Swing/Take
- not sure about the different Runs measures

Plate Discipline
- table of different stats (zone %) for each season

Percentile Rankings
- this is interesting since it places a percentile rank on each of these common pitch stats

Expected Home Runs
- table

Expected Home Runs by Park

Year to Year Changes
- like the general idea of comparing percentages from season to to the next season
- using the wrong scale to compare percentages
- maybe I should redo the table using legit comparisons?
