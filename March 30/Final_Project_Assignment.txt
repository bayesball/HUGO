Final Project Description

General task:

Write a post for the Exploring Baseball Data with R blog that describes what you learned over the past few months and how that relates to your baseball playing at AIG.

Proposed outline of your blog post.

1.  (Introduction.). Provide some background information about yourself including your background in playing baseball, your particular position on the AIG baseball team, and your goals for the future.

2.  (Current Use of Statistics.) What statistics are currently being used on your baseball team to rate players, specifically pitchers? What makes the top pitchers the best from a statistical viewpoint?

3.  (New Insights.). What have you recently learned about measurements of batters and pitchers?  What measures or related topics have you learned that were unexpected or unknown to you?

4.  (Application.). If you were coaching your high school team, what types of new measures of pitchers or hitters would you introduce?  How would these new measures help the coaches evaluate players?

Here are some questions to guide your writing:

a.  I know IMG Academy primarily for the development of tennis players such as the Williams sisters.  Can you describe how the IMG Academy works for a developing baseball player?

b.  Are there famous baseball players who have started at the IMG Academy?

c.  Currently what baseball stats are collected for your team for pitchers beyond the usual box score stats?

d.  Do they record what happens on each pitch? (Location, outcome of pitch, etc)

e.  What are attributes or measurements of pitchers that are currently not measured, but you wish they were?
