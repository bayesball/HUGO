Main question:  what are suitable measures for pitchers?

Read my blog post:

FanGraphs web site gives a large number of pitching measures of different types:

Dashboard
Standard
Advanced
Batted Ball
Win Probability
Pitch Value
Plate Discipline
Value
Pitch Info
+ Stats
Statcast

Which measures are used to determine the Cy Young awards each season?

What are some traditional measures?  What's wrong with these measures?

Problem:  some measures are impacted by other (non-pitching variables) such as the team performance or defensive fielding performance, ballpark, etc.

General question:  Which measures are best in assessing pitching ability?

One method:

- collect the measure for two consecutive seasons for a group of pitchers
- construct a scatterplot of the season measures
- generally see a positive association pattern
- strength of the association is measured by a correlation (falls between -1 and 1)
- larger correlation values correspond to measures reflecting pitcher abilities

I wrote a Shiny app where you can  play with these scatterplots:
